RAdCor is an atmospheric correction algorithm that can account for adjacency effects explicitly, by using realistic atmospheric point spread functions. RAdCor development was funded by the [BELSPO/STEREO programme](https://www.belspo.be/belspo/space/belspo_stereo_en.stm) under contract SR/00/406. For more information on RAdCor, check out the [website](https://odnature.naturalsciences.be/radcor/), [publication](https://doi.org/10.1364/AO.546766), and [ATBD](https://github.com/acolite/radcor_atbd).\n","\n","To run the code in the notebook, click the execute button next to each cell to run that particular cell. Since cells use outputs from preceding cells, please run them in order.\n","\n","The required dependencies are installed and the latest version of ACOLITE is cloned from [GitHub](https://github.com/acolite/acolite). The first run of a specific sensor will be slower as the sensor specific lookup tables (LUTs) are retrieved. Please note that all data (including LUTs) and installed software in the Colab instance are deleted after it expires. For more than occasional processing it is recommended to set up a local environment and install the software on your system.\n","\n","In this example, Sentinel-2 scenes are retrieved from the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (CDSE) and hence requires CDSE credentials to be configured. If you have no such account, please register at [CDSE](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/). Download speed of a scene to Google Drive will depend on the CDSE connection, and typically takes a few minutes.\n","\n","Optional ancillary data can be used if EarthData credentials are also set up.
