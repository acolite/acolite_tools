RAdCor is an atmospheric correction algorithm that can account for adjacency effects explicitly, by using realistic atmospheric point spread functions. RAdCor development was funded by the [BELSPO/STEREO programme](https://www.belspo.be/belspo/space/belspo_stereo_en.stm) under contract SR/00/406. For more information on RAdCor, check out the [website](https://odnature.naturalsciences.be/radcor/), [publication](https://doi.org/10.1364/AO.546766), and [ATBD](https://github.com/acolite/radcor_atbd).\n","\n","To run the code in the notebook, click the execute button next to each cell to run that particular cell. Since cells use outputs from preceding cells, please run them in order.\n","\n","The required dependencies are installed and the latest version of ACOLITE is cloned from [GitHub](https://github.com/acolite/acolite). The first run of a specific sensor will be slower as the sensor specific lookup tables (LUTs) are retrieved. Please note that all data (including LUTs) and installed software in the Colab instance are deleted after it expires. For more than occasional processing it is recommended to set up a local environment and install the software on your system.\n","\n","In this example, Landsat scenes are retrieved from the USGS EarthExplorer and hence requires EarthExplorer credentials to be configured. If you have no such account, please register at [EarthExplorer](https://ers.cr.usgs.gov/register) and [generate an M2M Application Token](https://www.usgs.gov/media/files/m2m-application-token-documentation). Download speed of a scene to Google Drive will depend on the EarthExplorer connection, and typically takes a few minutes.\n","\n","Optional ancillary data can be used if EarthData credentials are also set up. Register at the [EarthData Login](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/) page and select OB.DAAC Data Access and LP DAAC Data Pool in your profile under Authorised Apps, Approve More Applications.\n","\n","Author: Quinten Vanhellemont, RBINS, quinten.vanhellemont@naturalsciences.be\n","Created: 2025-07-01"],"metadata":{"id":"_gpo-KV7Dz_G"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"TMpbzOUmDweN"},"outputs":[],"source":["# general imports\n","import os, sys"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The next cell installs ACOLITE dependencies using pip.
